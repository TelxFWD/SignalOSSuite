🧠 Context:
SignalOS is a next-gen trading signal copier platform with a premium UI and partially complete backend. A feature gap analysis has been performed comparing it with industry leaders like TSC.

Goal: Implement the missing 80% functionality in a phased, stable, and modular way — without disturbing the current working modules.

🎯 Phase 1: High-Priority Features – Core Trading Engine

1. ✅ **Signal Source Expansion**
   - Enable multiple Telegram account sessions
   - Detect signal from private/public channels, groups, bots, chats
   - Support parsing from channels with copying disabled (using session-based access)

2. ✅ **Full Order Type Support**
   - Parse and execute BUY, SELL, BUY LIMIT/STOP, SELL LIMIT/STOP
   - Add pending order placement logic in MT5 EA or Python bridge
   - Add Smart Entry Mode:
     - Executes if current price within X pips of signal
     - Delays until spread narrows or price matches zone

3. ✅ **Provider Command Execution**
   - Parse command strings like: "Close 50%", "TP to 1.0932", "SL to entry"
   - Add actions in the trade engine:
     - Modify existing order
     - Partially close by % or lotsize
     - Cancel pending
     - Break-even
     - Track orders by ticket/message_id

4. ✅ **TP/SL Multi-Level & Movement Logic**
   - Support multiple TP levels (TP1, TP2, TP3…)
   - SL movement logic:
     - SL to entry after TP1
     - SL to TP1 after TP2, etc.
   - Override or append TP/SL values by user strategy

5. ✅ **Real MT5 Execution (via JSON or Direct DLL)**
   - Fix MT5 communication path
   - Validate order result
   - Store MT5 ticket + reference message link

🎯 Phase 2: Medium Priority Features – Risk Management + Control Layer

6. ✅ **Equity Guardian + Drawdown Management**
   - Auto-close all trades at profit/loss threshold ($ or %)
   - Stop accepting new signals after threshold hit
   - Apply rules globally or per provider

7. ✅ **Advanced Lot Size Management**
   - Support:
     - Fixed lots
     - % of balance
     - Risk-to-SL ratio
     - From signal message (e.g., "risk 0.5%")
   - Validate pip value calculation per pair

8. ✅ **Trailing SL + Break-even Logic**
   - Fixed pip trailing
   - R:R based trailing
   - Trigger break-even after X pips or TP1

9. ✅ **News Filter + Time Window Rules**
   - Block signals X mins before/after news events (integrate with ForexFactory/News API)
   - Define user time ranges (e.g., 10 AM – 4 PM only)
   - Limit signal volume (per day/channel/pair)

10. ✅ **Entry Point & Spread Logic**
    - Adjust entry with +/- pip buffer
    - Allow user to pick “Best”, “Average”, or 2nd entry from message
    - Validate entry deviation vs market price before execution

🎯 Phase 3: Advanced Features – Strategy Personalization + White Label

11. ✅ **Grid + Reverse Strategy**
   - Open layered grid if signal matches preset
   - Reverse BUY → SELL logic on user toggle

12. ✅ **Prop Firm Stealth Layer**
   - Auto-random delay
   - Remove comments
   - SL/TP masking
   - Cap lots per pair

13. ✅ **Signal Strategy Rules**
   - Assign strategy to each provider/pair combo
   - Rule engine: JSON or GUI editor
   - Include RR config, SL logic, SL-to-entry settings

14. ✅ **Analytics + Signal Quality**
   - TP hit %, average RR, slippage delay, missed entry %
   - Compare providers
   - Export data
   - Show live trade feed by provider

15. ✅ **Replay & Recovery**
   - Let users re-trigger missed signals manually
   - Fix parsing errors and resend signals via Admin panel

🧱 Implementation Notes:
- Use modular services: `signal_parser.py`, `execution_engine.py`, `risk_manager.py`, `mt5_bridge.py`
- Ensure trade logs always track: timestamp, signal source, parser version, execution status
- Enable admin panel to toggle each rule (e.g., break-even ON/OFF, SL buffer = 5 pips)

📦 Deliverables:
- Fully integrated signal execution engine
- Rule-based and AI-enhanced parser
- Signal edit/update → modifies trade
- MT5 sync confirmed with ticket IDs
- Real-time health and performance tracking

🎯 End Goal:
Bring SignalOS to 100% feature parity (and beyond) with TSC — with a modern UI, real AI parsing, stealth capability, and full user/provider control.
