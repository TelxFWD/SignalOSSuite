   - Pending order placement with expiry management
   - Real-time price feeds and spread monitoring
   - Account information retrieval (balance, equity, margin)
   - Position management (open, modify, close, partial close)

2. **Advanced Order Execution Engine**:
   - Smart Entry Mode with optimal execution timing
   - Spread-based entry optimization
   - Dual entry point handling
   - Range-based entry selection
   - Entry price deviation validation
   - Retry mechanism for failed orders

3. **Multi-Asset Support**:

   - Break-even automation with customizable trigger points
   - Custom SL adjustments and modifications
   - Spread-aware SL placement
   - SL movement commands from providers
   - Hidden SL implementation for stealth

3. **Prop-Firm Stealth Features**:

## Implementation Notes:

1. **Each phase builds on the previous one** - maintain compatibility
2. **Test thoroughly** after each phase before moving to the next
3. **Use the existing architecture** - enhance rather than rebuild
4. **Maintain the premium UI** - ensure all new features integrate seamlessly
5. **Keep simulation mode** available for testing and demo purposes
6. **Document extensively** for future maintenance and expansion

## Success Metrics:
- **Phase 1**: Real trading with all order types working
- **Phase 2**: Multi-provider support with advanced risk management
- **Phase 3**: Prop-firm compatible with advanced strategies
- **Phase 4**: Enterprise-ready with comprehensive analytics

This roadmap will transform SignalOS from 15% feature completeness to 95%+ professional signal copying software capability.
