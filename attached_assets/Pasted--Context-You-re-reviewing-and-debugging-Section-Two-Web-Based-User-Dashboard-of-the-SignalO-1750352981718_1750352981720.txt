🧠 Context:
You’re reviewing and debugging **Section Two: Web-Based User Dashboard** of the SignalOS Project. The dashboard is built with React.js (frontend) and connects to a Flask/FastAPI backend. It is responsible for user onboarding, channel and terminal setup, strategy management, health monitoring, and analytics.

🎯 Objective:
1. Detect and fix all **bugs, UI glitches, or logic inconsistencies**
2. Compare against the expected roadmap features below
3. Ensure **each user function works correctly and securely**
4. Finalize Section Two for production or integration with the Windows App

🔍 Modules to Review & Audit:
1. ✅ User Authentication & License Manager
2. ✅ Telegram Session Management (.session file or QR login)
3. ✅ Channel Detection & Signal Source Configuration
4. ✅ MT5/MT4 Terminal Setup & Mapping
5. ✅ Beginner/Pro Strategy Builder UI
6. ✅ Performance & Equity Analytics Dashboard
7. ✅ Shadow Mode + Simulated Testing
8. ✅ Strategy Import/Export (.json or QR)
9. ✅ Health Monitoring & Troubleshooting Panel

🔧 Checklist of Features to Verify & Complete:
- [ ] All dashboard forms (MT5, strategy, channel) are saving correctly to backend
- [ ] Strategy builder generates valid and structured logic output
- [ ] Telegram sessions persist correctly and show channel activity
- [ ] Channel-to-terminal mapping reflects correctly in backend state
- [ ] Shadow Mode executes logic without affecting real accounts
- [ ] Config import/export (JSON or QR) works end-to-end
- [ ] Health UI shows parser/EA status, signal errors, and sync time
- [ ] WebSocket or polling updates signal feed live
- [ ] Responsive UI layout works for mobile and tablet
- [ ] Proper error states and recovery for session, backend failure, or MT5 desync

🛠 What You Should Do:
1. Run full test cycle:
   - Login → Add Telegram → Add Channel → Create Strategy → Connect MT5 → Simulate Signal
2. Trigger edge cases:
   - No MT5 terminal selected
   - Invalid strategy
   - Broken or disconnected Telegram session
3. Check logs and browser console for:
   - API failures
   - Signal not reaching health panel
   - Wrong or missing configs
4. Fix missing functionality or inconsistencies:
   - Save buttons not working
   - Default rules not applying to new providers
   - UI state not syncing with backend

📦 Output:
- ✅ Summary of fixed bugs
- ✅ List of missing or completed features
- ✅ Screenshots of updated dashboard (optional)
- ✅ Recommendations for optimization (UI/UX, API efficiency)

🧪 Bonus (Optional):
Add a dummy parser model + fake signals to simulate signal load and UI state flow during demo/test mode.
