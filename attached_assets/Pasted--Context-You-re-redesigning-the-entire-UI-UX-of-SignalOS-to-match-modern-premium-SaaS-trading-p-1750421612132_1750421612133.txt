🧠 Context:
You’re redesigning the entire UI/UX of SignalOS to match modern, premium SaaS trading platforms. The current layout is functional but lacks polish, visual hierarchy, and interaction feedback.

🎯 Objective:
1. Redesign both User Dashboard and Admin Panel to look clean, modern, and high-converting
2. Make the interface beginner-friendly yet pro-functional
3. Improve system status readability and button interactions
4. Add clear data visualizations for trades, drawdown, uptime, and signal performance

📦 UI Framework:
Use one of the following for consistency and responsiveness:
- Tailwind CSS (recommended)
- ShadCN or Chakra UI for prebuilt polished components
- Font: `Inter`, `Sora`, or `Poppins`

🖥 User Dashboard Improvements:

1. **Top Header Bar**
   - Left: SignalOS Logo + Section title (Overview, Telegram, etc.)
   - Center: Navigation tabs with clear hover/active styles
   - Right: Plan badge, system status (✅ Online / ⚠ Offline)

2. **Stats Cards (Overview Panel)**
   - Redesign using card grid (4-column layout)
   - Add icons next to “Trades Today”, “Total Pips”, etc.
   - Add small sparkline chart (optional) under each card

3. **System Health Panel**
   - Use color-coded tags (🟢 Connected, 🔴 Disconnected, 🟡 Syncing)
   - Add tooltips explaining what “Disconnected” means
   - Optional: Mini real-time graph showing uptime %

4. **Quick Actions**
   - Replace blue buttons with stylish card buttons:
     - 📲 Setup Telegram
     - 💼 Add MT5 Terminal
     - ⚙️ Create Strategy
   - Hover animations and loading feedback on click

5. **Side Navigation**
   - Icons next to items (Lucide or Feather icons)

   - Use shadowed or glassmorphic cards for:
     - Total Users
     - Active Users
     - Signals, Trades
     - System Health

2. **Charts + Analytics**
   - Add bar/line charts (Chart.js or Recharts) for:
     - Signal performance by provider
     - TP1/TP2/TP3 hit ratio
     - Trade execution speed
     - Server health stats

3. **System Logs**
   - Use a paginated table with severity tags
   - Add copy-to-clipboard for trace ID or log details

4. **Notifications**
   - Add snackbar alerts or toast for system events
   - Display push status: “Signal sent”, “Parser error”, etc.

💡 Extra UX Ideas:

- Show terminal avatar or broker logo per MT5 account
- Make Telegram session status a toggle switch
- Allow light/dark mode switch in settings
- Add tutorial overlay or “First-Time Setup Wizard”
- Use tooltips on all advanced options (e.g., TP override, SL buffer)

📦 Deliverables:
- Updated `src/components/*` or `pages/Dashboard.jsx` layout
- Responsive version for tablets and smaller laptops
- Updated `tailwind.config.js` with theme palette
- Replace legacy CSS with Tailwind or styled-components

🎯 Goal:
Make SignalOS feel like a premium, scalable fintech platform — modern, clean, beginner-friendly, and instantly impressive to both users and providers.
